# DJSng's Oldcord
A personal edit of Oldcord, a 2020 UI theme for Discord created by Milbits and kinggamingyt.
**This is not a replacement for the original Oldcord**, nor associated with the original repository. You should see [the original repository](https://github.com/milbits/oldcord) for that.  
Do not ask for support on my fork on their repo. Just use the original OldCord, if you're having issues.  

Created to work with my own preferences while also having an online backup.

## Changes made
- Commented out profile.css by default (you can still enable it if you want)  
- Added commented explanations to all the modules of Oldcord (QOL for anybody customizing)  
- Restored clan tags by commenting out relevant other.css code  

## Planned features
- Compatibility with Dorion v6.7 and later
