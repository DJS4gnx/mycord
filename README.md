# DJSng's Oldcord
A personal edit of Oldcord, a 2020 UI theme for Discord created by Milbits and kinggamingyt.
**This is not a replacement for the original Oldcord**, nor associated with the original repository. You should see [the original repository](https://github.com/milbits/oldcord) for that.  
Do not ask for support on my fork on their repo. Just use the original OldCord, if you're having issues.  

Created to work with my own preferences while also having an online backup.

## Changes made
- OldCord.theme.css uses my preferences by default (everything on EXCEPT profiles.css)  
- Added commented explanations to all the modules of Oldcord (QOL for anybody customizing)  
- Make clan tag removal an opt-in addon instead of a forced opt-out (to make it togglable)  

## Planned features
- Compatibility with Dorion v6.7 and later

You will unfortunately have to uncomment and recomment stuff I've edited if you want to make changes to what's enabled and disabled.   
By default, the theme uses my own settings.
