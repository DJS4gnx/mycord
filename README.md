# DJSng's Oldcord
A personal edit of Oldcord, a 2020 UI theme for Discord created by Milbits and kinggamingyt.
**This is not a replacement for the original Oldcord**, nor associated with the original repository. You should see [the original repository](https://github.com/milbits/oldcord) for that.  
Do not ask for support on my fork on their repo. Just use the original OldCord, if you're having issues.  

This branch tries to remove the titlebar, while not having the ugly line bug on Dorion clients.
