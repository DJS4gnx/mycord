# DJSng's Oldcord
A personal edit of Oldcord, a 2020 UI theme for Discord created by Milbits and kinggamingyt.
**This is not a replacement for the original Oldcord**, nor associated with the original repository. You should see [the original repository](https://github.com/milbits/oldcord) for that.  
Do not ask for support on my fork on their repo. Just use the original OldCord, if you're having issues.  

Created to work with my own preferences while also having an online backup.

## Changes made
- OldCord.theme.css uses my preferences by default (everything on EXCEPT profiles.css)  
- Added commented explanations to all the modules of Oldcord (QOL for anybody customizing)  
- Clan tag removal is now a separate addon, not other.css (I did this because showEffects.css wouldn't re-enable them)  
- Alternative redesign.css file for Dorion v6.7+ users  
- Additional addon to remove Window Control for Official Discord Client users (Windows only)  


## Planned features
N/A

## Optional addons
- Hide clan tags  
- Hide Discord window controls (Official Discord Client users)  
- redesign.css alternative for Dorion users  
- Most of the original OldCord addons (showEffects, oldEmojis, oldContext)
